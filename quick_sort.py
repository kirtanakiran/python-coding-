#Choose a value in the array to be the pivot element.
#Order the rest of the array so that lower values than the pivot element are on the left, and higher values are on the right.
#Swap the pivot element with the first element of the higher values so that the pivot element lands in between the lower and higher values.
#Do the same operations (recursively) for the sub-arrays on the left and right side of the pivot element.
#complexity - O(nlogn)
